# GSoC2020: Hand gesture detection and recognition in news videos

This is my GSoC2020 project with Red Hen Lab. 

The goal is to design a network capable of detecting and recognizing hand gestures and then apply it to annotate the dataset of news videos of Red Hen Lab.

# Preprocessing of Dataset IEMOCAP

```mocap_data_collect.py``` extract information from the IEMOCAP dataset and save the data as pickle.

# Audio-Visual emtion recognition

Audio-only, visual-only and audio-visual models are tested to verify the utility of bimodal information.
